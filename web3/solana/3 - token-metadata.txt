1. Go to https://explorer.solana.com/ and select Devnet

2. Search for the solana fs wallet address FAn7nLwyKakguMQGnsNjCCyrssZKA9hhuKihR281ArHQ 
   and check the SOL balance (should be slightly lower than 1 SOL because we've spent
   with gas fees to mint and transfer tokens in devnet) and transaction history
   Balance (SOL)  ◎0.99090896

3. Search for the solana phantom wallet address HcG8R8hYmnwhnPbvRwNn3jPUoXiyfahBxzGx8sfj2SPh 
   and check the SOL balance (should be exactly 1 SOL, since we did an airdrop to devnet
   of 1 SOL earlier using the faucet https://solfaucet.com/) and transaction history
   Balance (SOL)  ◎1

4. Search for the fungible token smart contract address CoM7cSQWFcpdLFrrDvxn5Jdg4wkfWSdoEqGw7Df3RsoU
   and verify that: token is unknown, supply is 1 billion, etc

5. Search for the non-fungible token (NFT) smart contract address 5vUAGL5SP3LVFpzWxVcmC5wjGbm4smDqFzY9DY6SRTHn
   and verify that: token is unknown, supply is fixed equals 1, etc

6. Search for the token account smart contract and check the balance, verifying: who minted, who is the
   owner, and the token balance

7. Now, let's give the token a name and an image. Go to GitHub (github.com/solana-labs/token-list).
   Since Nov/2022, Solana has discontinued the Github repo and now the official primary means of adding metadata
   to the token is using Metaplex

8. The token metadata required by the Metaplex protocol will be stored in the permaweb (could be also stored 
   on a regular centralized cloud server). We will use Arweave. First we create a wallet and ask for some
   free tokens from their faucet (after exhausting, we need to buy them). 
   Links: 
   - Aerweave faucet: https://faucet.arweave.net/
   - Aerweave app: arweave.app/wallet

9. Now let's install the aerweave npm package and:
   - Upload our image in the permaweb: npx ts-node ./arweaveUploadImage.ts  
   - Upload our metaplex JSON file in the permaweb: npx ts-node ./arweaveUploadTokenJSON.ts

10. Metaplex does not offer a cli for this, but rather a javascript lib. 
   So, we will start by installing some node packages:
   - npm install @metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata --save
   - npm install --save @solana/web3.js
   - npm install @project-serum/anchor --save

11. Copy the fs wallet key-pair created for our token intto the project directory 
   renaming it to fs-sol-wallet-id.json

12. Run the ts file to create the token metadata (check the INITIALIZE flag to see if it is first time or update): 
   - npx ts-node ./metaplexCreateTokenMetadata.ts 

13. Check at:
   - SOL explorer the token meta: https://explorer.solana.com/ in Devnet address CoM7...
   - Phantom wallet in Devnet
   - Solscan in Devnet https://solscan.io/token/CoM7cSQWFcpdLFrrDvxn5Jdg4wkfWSdoEqGw7Df3RsoU?cluster=devnet
